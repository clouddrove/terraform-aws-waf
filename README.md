We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform--aws-waf/releases).


### Simple example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
module "waf" {
source      = "clouddrove/waf/aws"
version     = "1.3.0"

name                 = "waf"
environment          = "test"
allow_default_action = true
waf_enabled          = true
waf_scop             = "REGIONAL"

web_acl_association = false

visibility_config = {
  cloudwatch_metrics_enabled = true
  sampled_requests_enabled   = true
}

rules = [
  {
    name     = "AWSManagedRulesAmazonIpReputationList"
    priority = "0"

    override_action = "none"

    visibility_config = {
      cloudwatch_metrics_enabled = true
      metric_name                = "AWS-AWSManagedRulesAmazonIpReputationList"
      sampled_requests_enabled   = true
    }

    managed_rule_group_statement = {
      name        = "AWSManagedRulesAmazonIpReputationList"
      vendor_name = "AWS"
    }
  },

  {
    name     = "rate-limit"
    priority = "1"
    action   = "block"

    visibility_config = {
      cloudwatch_metrics_enabled = true
      metric_name                = "rate-limit"
      sampled_requests_enabled   = true
    }

    rate_based_statement = {
      limit              = 2000
      aggregate_key_type = "IP"
    }
  }
]

#logs

create_logging_configuration = false
redacted_fields = [
  {
    single_header = {
      name = "user-agent"
    }
  }
]
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| allow\_default\_action | Set to `true` for WAF to allow requests by default. Set to `false` for WAF to block requests by default. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| block\_sensitive\_paths | n/a | `bool` | `null` | no |
| create\_logging\_configuration | Whether to create logging configuration in order start logging from a WAFv2 Web ACL to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| firehose\_buffer\_interval | Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in seconds, before delivering it to the destination. Valid value is between 60-900. Smaller value makes the logs delivered faster. Bigger value increase the chance to make the file size bigger, which are more efficient to query. | `number` | `900` | no |
| firehose\_buffer\_size | Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MBs, before delivering it to the destination. Valid value is between 64-128. Recommended is 128, specifying a smaller buffer size can result in the delivery of very small S3 objects, which are less efficient to query. | `number` | `128` | no |
| ip\_addresses | (Required) Contains an array of strings that specify one or more IP addresses or blocks of IP addresses in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. AWS WAF supports all address ranges for IP versions IPv4 and IPv6. | `list(string)` | `null` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| logging\_filter | A configuration block that specifies which web requests are kept in the logs and which are dropped. You can filter on the rule action and on the web request labels that were applied by matching rules during web ACL evaluation. | `any` | `{}` | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove' | `string` | `"CloudDrove"` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| redacted\_fields | The parts of the request that you want to keep out of the logs. Up to 100 `redacted_fields` blocks are supported. | `any` | `[]` | no |
| repository | Terraform current module repo | `string` | `"https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-waf"` | no |
| resource\_arn | ARN of the ALB or cloudfront to be associated with the WAFv2 ACL. | `string` | `""` | no |
| resource\_arn\_list | ARN  List of the ALB or cloudfront to be associated with the WAFv2 ACL. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| rules | List of WAF rules. | `any` | `[]` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. map(`BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`). | `map(any)` | `{}` | no |
| visibility\_config | Visibility config for WAFv2 web acl. https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/wafv2_web_acl.html#visibility-configuration | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| waf\_enabled | Flag to control the waf creation for load balancer. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| waf\_scop | n/a | `string` | `"REGIONAL"` | no |
| web\_acl\_association | If we associated with any resources to WAF | `bool` | `true` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| arn | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) specifying the role. |
| id | Name of specifying the role. |
| ip\_set\_arn | The ARN of Ip\_set |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
